MY SSH  
Implement a client/server pair capable of encrypted authentication and communication.  
The server will execute commands from the client and return their output to the client.  
The commands are executable from the path with any number of arguments; cd and pwd will function normally.  
Multiple commands can be executed sequentially or redirected using: |, <, >, &&, ||, ;.
